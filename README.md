Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)	Data cleaning and EDA
SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)	Data querying and aggregation
Power BI	Dashboard creation
Gamma App	Presentation and storytelling
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code	Development environment
🔍 Steps Followed
1. Data Loading & Cleaning

Loaded the dataset in Python using Pandas.

Handled missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.

Normalized column names and converted date fields.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed key metrics like total sales, profit, and average order value.
